We'll be presenting at src/main/insides/FileTree, and the rest of this document will be explaining FileTree's relationship to the rest of the project.

This code enables the saving and writing of files to the drive, in addition to building the UI and the relationship between UI objects.
In particular this code allows the user to make a project, add items to projects, Saving projects, and adding and removing tabs.
As of now, there are not test files for the FileTree class.
As for build automation, it's still a work in progess. We are automatically building a jar file upon saving our code. We are looking into why it won't run.
